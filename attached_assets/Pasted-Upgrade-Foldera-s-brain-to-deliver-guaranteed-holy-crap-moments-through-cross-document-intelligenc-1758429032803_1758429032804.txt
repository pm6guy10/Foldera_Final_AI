Upgrade Foldera's brain to deliver guaranteed "holy crap" moments through cross-document intelligence.

CORE MISSION: Make every upload surface at least ONE high-stakes finding that would genuinely terrify a professional if missed.

1. CROSS-DOCUMENT DETECTION ENGINE
   - Compare EVERY numeric value across ALL docs (amounts, percentages, dates)
   - Pattern: "Doc A says $2M, Doc B says $2.75M" â†’ flag with exact locations
   - Pattern: "Contract states March 31, Amendment says April 15" â†’ critical conflict
   - Pattern: "Vendor named 'Accenture' in SOW, 'Accenture Corp' in invoice" â†’ entity mismatch
   - ALWAYS compare: budgets, deadlines, entity names, percentages, deliverables

2. CONSEQUENCE CALCULATOR (make it terrifying)
   Each finding MUST include:
   - Dollar impact: "âš  $750k discrepancy â†’ $1.2M penalty under Section 5.2"
   - Time impact: "ðŸ“… 3-week delay â†’ Breach of contract, liquidated damages"
   - Compliance impact: "ðŸ”’ Missing attestation â†’ SOC2 violation, client loss risk"
   Formula: [Issue] â†’ [Specific penalty/risk] with section reference

3. INSTANT FIX GENERATOR
   Each issue gets ONE actionable fix:
   - Financial: "Subject: Budget Discrepancy - Urgent Correction\n\nDear [CFO],\n\nWe've identified a $750k variance between the master agreement ($2M) and Amendment 2 ($2.75M). Please confirm which figure is correct. See attached reconciliation.\n\nBest,\n[Your name]"
   - Timeline: "Revised Milestone: [specific dates and deliverables]"
   - Compliance: "Vendor Attestation Request: [pre-filled template]"
   Make fixes so good users can copy/paste immediately

4. BLOOMBERG-STYLE AUDIT LOG
   Stream these in real-time as analysis happens:
   [2025-09-21 16:45:22.123] SCAN_INITIATED: 3 documents, 47 pages
   [2025-09-21 16:45:22.789] CRITICAL: Budget mismatch $2M vs $2.75M (Doc1:p4 vs Doc2:p7)
   [2025-09-21 16:45:23.234] FIX_GENERATED: CFO notification email drafted
   [2025-09-21 16:45:23.567] HIGH: Timeline conflict detected March 31 vs April 15
   [2025-09-21 16:45:24.012] FIX_GENERATED: Milestone revision prepared

IMPLEMENTATION:
- File: documentProcessingService.ts
- Add crossDocumentAnalysis() that compares ALL docs in batch
- Add consequenceCalculator() that estimates real penalties
- Add fixGenerator() that creates ready-to-send fixes
- Add auditLogger() with millisecond timestamps
- Ensure findings are REAL (from actual document content)
- NO fabrication except in /simulation mode

ACCEPTANCE:
- Upload 2+ docs â†’ ALWAYS finds at least 1 cross-doc discrepancy
- Every issue shows: severity + dollar/time consequence + fix
- Audit log streams live with Bloomberg styling
- Fixes are professional and ready to copy/paste
