What's Already Perfect (Keep These):

The Ocean/Wave Effect - That's gorgeous and unique. Very few SaaS sites have this.
Dark slate background (#0a2540 → #1b1b1d) - Professional, easy on eyes
Cyan accent (#00cccc) - Your signature color, distinctive
Clean typography (Inter + monospace) - Readable, professional
The "Productivity Ghost" headline - Killer copy, memorable

Critical Fixes Needed:
1. Navigation (Must Work)
javascript// Current: Dead links
// Fix: Make these actually scroll or route
<nav>
  <a href="#features">Features</a>
  <a href="#pricing">Pricing</a>
  <a href="#security">Security</a>
</nav>
2. Hero CTAs
javascript// Both buttons should do something
"See Live Demo" → Opens /simulation route
"Book a Security-Cleared Demo" → Opens demo booking form
3. Pricing Section Spacing
css/* Fix the cramped pricing cards */
.pricing-card {
  padding: 2rem; /* More breathing room */
  margin: 1rem;
}

/* Fix "Contact Sales" button alignment */
.enterprise-card button {
  margin-top: auto; /* Push to bottom */
}
4. Trust Copy Update
Instead of generic company logos, be specific:
html<!-- Old -->
"Trusted by professionals at McKinsey..."

<!-- New -->
"Built for elite operators at organizations like McKinsey..."
5. The Ocean Effect (Enhanced)
Your current wave is static. Make it move subtly:
javascript// Add subtle animation to existing gradient
@keyframes oceanFlow {
  0% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
  50% { background-position: 100% 50%; }
  100% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
}

.ocean-bg {
  background-size: 200% 200%;
  animation: oceanFlow 15s ease infinite;
}
The "Steve Jobs Just Works" Test:
Your site passes visually but fails functionally:

✅ Clean, minimal design
✅ Clear value prop ("Stop Babysitting")
✅ Visual hierarchy works
❌ Buttons don't work
❌ No actual demo
❌ Can't actually sign up

Quick CSS Fixes for Polish:
css/* Add more spacing between sections */
section {
  padding: 4rem 0; /* Up from current 2rem */
}

/* Fix pricing card heights */
.pricing-tier {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 500px;
}

/* Make CTAs more prominent */
.cta-button {
  padding: 1rem 2rem; /* Bigger touch targets */
  font-weight: 600;
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

/* Fix mobile responsiveness */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .pricing-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
  h1 { font-size: 2rem; }
}
The Conversion Optimizer's Take:
Keep your aesthetic - it's distinctive and professional. But make these changes:

Hero: Add "Watch 20-second demo" button that actually works
Trust Bar: Change to "Built for elite operators" (honest)
Landmines Section: This is gold, keep it prominent
Audit Log: Make it animate/type in real-time
Pricing: Fix spacing, make "Start Trial" actually work
Footer CTA: Working email capture with real backend

The ocean gradient and dark theme are perfect for enterprise SaaS. Don't change the aesthetic - just make everything actually work. The visual says "premium tool" but broken links say "amateur hour."
