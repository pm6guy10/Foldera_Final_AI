Next Prompt: The Fix Generator & Consequence Calculator
Enhance Foldera's fix generation to create copy-paste ready solutions with terrifying consequences.

CORE MISSION: Every detected issue must show catastrophic impact + instant solution.

1. CONSEQUENCE CALCULATOR
For each finding, calculate and display:
- Dollar impact with specific penalty clause reference
- Time impact with contract breach implications  
- Compliance impact with regulatory citations
Pattern: "⚠ $750k variance → $1.2M penalty (Section 5.2 liquidated damages)"

2. FIX GENERATOR
Create professional, ready-to-send fixes:

Financial discrepancy fix:
Subject: URGENT - Budget Variance Requires Immediate Correction
Dear [CFO Name],

Amendment 2 (pg 7): $2,750,000
Variance: $750,000 (37.5%)

Risk: Exceeds board-approved budget threshold. Penalty exposure $1.2M under Section 5.2.
