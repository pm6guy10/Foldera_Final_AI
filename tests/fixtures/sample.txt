MEMO
TO: Legal Department
FROM: Compliance Officer
DATE: January 15, 2025
RE: Contract Review - Budget Allocation Discrepancy

This memo outlines several potential compliance issues identified during our quarterly review:

1. BUDGET VARIANCE: The allocated budget of $250,000 conflicts with the approved expenditure limit of $150,000 as stated in Section 4.2 of the Master Agreement.

2. DEADLINE CONFLICT: Contract completion date specified as March 30, 2025, contradicts the project timeline requiring delivery by February 28, 2025.

3. JURISDICTION ISSUES: The contract specifies Delaware law governs disputes, while our corporate policy mandates California jurisdiction for all agreements exceeding $100,000.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Immediate review with legal counsel
- Budget reallocation approval required
- Timeline extension request
- Jurisdiction clause amendment

Please review these discrepancies within 48 hours.

Best regards,
Compliance Team
