Your only job is to make Foldera’s landing page Steve Jobs–elegant, investor-grade, and fully mobile-optimized. 
The MVP loop already works. This run is polish-only.

Do not add pages. Do not touch backend, Stripe, upload, or discrepancy logic. 
Deliver one updated landing page that is conversion-optimized, mobile-ready, and visually clean.

DESIGN & UX REQUIREMENTS
- Mobile-first: large tap targets, generous spacing, readable type on small screens.
- Color: dark background with cyan/green accents. No purple anywhere.
- Hierarchy: one primary CTA per viewport. No competing buttons.
- Preserve existing animations: audit-log typewriter and “nightmare” carousel.
- All nav links must point to real anchors or routes. No dead links.
- SEO: keep H1/H2 concise; include terms like compliance, audit log, enterprise, boardroom.

# Foldera

## Stop Babysitting the AI Productivity Ghost.
Three years into the “future of work,” AI is still a ghost.
99 productivity apps later, your neck is still on the line when it screws up.

Foldera shows up.
It doesn’t summarize. It strategizes. It sees risks before they blow up — and hands you the receipts.

## This Is Your Brain on Gen-1 AI
A constant stream of babysitting, second-guessing, and busywork.

- Find latest P&L numbers… wait, not those ones.
- Does the proposal mention the Q3 budget cap?
- Re-remind the AI about the client’s NDA.
- Draft email to legal. No, check compliance doc first.
- What did Sarah say on that call last Tuesday?
- The deck still has the old logo.

## This Is Your Brain on Foldera
Foldera doesn’t summarize — it strategizes. You wake up to a briefing with clear, immediate moves.

### 1. It Sees Everything
Scans every doc, transcript, and draft.

### 2. It Connects Dots
Flags contradictions, risks, and silent landmines before they explode.

### 3. It Makes Moves
The counter-offer, the fixed deck, the compliant filing. You just hit approve.

## Three Landmines. Three Deliverables. All Before Coffee.

Budget Bomb Neutralized
Proposal assumed $180K upfront. Client said “cash-strapped until Q2.”
Deliverable: Pre-written staged payment plan email.

Version Grenade Disarmed
Deck was about to ship with outdated P&L.
Deliverable: Corrected investor deck with live data.

Deadline Landmine Flagged
Critical compliance filing buried in 200+ emails.
Deliverable: Filing submitted 3 days early.
